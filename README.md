**Repository Name:** CarControlSimulation

**Description:**
A simple Java application that simulates basic car control functionalities. This project demonstrates a `Car` class with methods for accelerating and braking. The program interacts with the user through a graphical interface using `JOptionPane`, allowing users to:

- Input the car's make and year model.
- Control the car's speed by accelerating or braking.
- Exit the program while displaying the final speed of the car.

The application showcases fundamental object-oriented programming concepts and basic GUI handling in Java.
